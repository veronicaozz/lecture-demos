# A Forced Merge Conflict

Unfortunately, the manner in which I created this merge conflict can only be done once.  Lectures 13 and 15 can give you a somewhat equivalent experience with merging, but that will be across branches you are making rather than a merge conflict with another user across forks.

If you missed the demo in class, it isn't all that important.  Just skip ahead to Lecture 13 and make your branch, and merge it from Lecture 15.
